        An image to encode can be uploaded in the Tile Input step. It can only encode
        a 64x64 area which is called a tile in the left-top of the image. On the other
        hand you can input your intermediate data in the Input tab and compute the
        results at each step. You can also find the source code of each step by clicking
        the Code button. Detailed description of the RemoteFX encode codec please refer to
        the Microsoft Open Specification [<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff635423.aspx">MS-RDPRFX</a>].
