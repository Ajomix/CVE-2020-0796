             (MS-SSIM) is layered on SSIM. The algorithm calculates multiple SSIM
             values at multiple image scales (resolutions). By running the algorithm at different scales,
             the quality of the image is evaluated for different viewing distances. MS-SSIM also puts less
             emphasis on the luminance component compared to the contrast and structure components. In
             total, MS-SSIM has been shown to increase the correlation between the MS-SSIM index and
             subjective quality tests. However, the trade-off is that MS-SSIM takes a few times longer
             to run than the straight SSIM algorithm. The detailed information you can refer to <a href="#ref">here</a> or this
