    <h2>RemoteFX Decoding Codec</h2>
    <p>
        The RemoteFX codec has been designed to achieve efficient compression,
        satisfying the goals of high quality and low latency while using a
        modest amount of computing resources. It is a tile-based transform codec.
        The transform chosen was a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) because it
        enables superior compression performance when compressing textual bitmap
        regions at high quality. The entropy coding is performed using the
        Run-Length Golomb-Rice Coder (RLGR), which yields compression gains
        at relatively low computing requirements. RemoteFX decoding is the inverse
        process of the RemoteFX encoding. You can use <a id="remotefx-decoding-codec" style="cursor:pointer">this example</a>
        in the MS-RDPRFX specification to try RemoteFX decoding codec.
