    <h2>RemoteFX Progressive Decoding Codec</h2>
    <p>
        The RemoteFX Progressive Codec extends the RemoteFX Codec ([MS-RDPRFX]) by adding sub-band
        diffing and the ability to progressively encode an image. Sub-band diffing is a compression
        technique that entails transmitting the differences between the DWT coefficients of consecutive
        frames, while progressive encoding involves the transmission of low-quality images that are
        gradually refined and improved in quality. RemoteFX progressive decoding is the inverse process
        of the RemoteFx progressive encoding.
