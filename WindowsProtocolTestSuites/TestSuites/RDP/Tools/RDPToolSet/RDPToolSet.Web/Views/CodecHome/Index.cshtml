        One of the core requirements of desktop remoting is the ability to efficiently
        compress server-side screen images so that they can be transported over a network
        and displayed on a client screen. Any codec used for this purpose needs to be able
        to deliver effective compression (to reduce network bandwidth requirements) and
        operate with low-latency (to enable efficient interactions with remoted content).
        A typical desktop screen contains textual content (synthetic images) along with
        video and photographic content (natural images). Given the sensitivity of the
        human eye to the sharp features present in textual content, any applied compression
        has to be visually lossless; otherwise the text will appear blurred.

            RemoteFX is a tile-based transform codec. It has the same functional stages as those found
            in most structured compression systems. At the encode endpoint, these stages are transform,
            quantization, and entropy encoding. The inverse of these operations (in the reverse order)
            takes place at the decode endpoint. RemoteFX uses DWTs and Run-Length Golomb-Rice Coding
            (RLGR) for transformation and entropy encoding respectively.

        <dd>
            The RemoteFX Progressive Codec extends the RemoteFX Codec ([MS-RDPRFX]) by adding sub-band
            diffing and the ability to progressively encode an image. Sub-band diffing is a compression
            technique that entails transmitting the differences between the DWT coefficients of consecutive
            frames, while progressive encoding involves the transmission of low-quality images that are
            gradually refined and improved in quality.
