| □ | Choose how you will run the preconfigured Test Cases of the **RDP Client Test Suite**. | See [Choosing the RDP Test Case Execution Method](#choosing-the-rdp-test-case-execution-method). |
| | | |

### Choosing the RDP Test Case Execution Method

After you complete all the tasks specified in the [RDP Client Test Suite
Setup Overview](#rdp-client-test-suite-setup-overview), you are ready to
run the preconfigured Test Cases via command line scripts (.ps1), or you
may use the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) UI-based tool to automate or
simplify the performance of various functions.

Among the most important of these functions are the following:

-   Reviewing the execution environment (**Domain** or **Workgroup**).

-   Automatically detecting, inspecting, and validating the **SUT**
    computer environment configuration and capabilities for test
    readiness.

-   Creating a default set of Test Cases, based on the assessed **SUT**
    environment.

-   Selecting (filtering) Test Cases to create an execution test set.

-   Executing Test Cases.

-   Viewing test results with built-in output data analysis features.

*More Information*

To execute Test Cases via .ps1 scripts, see [Running All Test
Cases](#running-all-test-cases) and [Running Specific Test
Cases](#running-specific-test-cases).

To execute Test Cases via the **PTM**, see [Using the Protocol Test
Manager](#using-protocol-test-manager).

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Tips

Once you have the **PTM** set up with specific set of Test Cases that
you run repeatedly for a particular purpose, you can save the test set
as a **Profile** and thereafter trigger Test Cases to run on demand from
the command line, as described in [Working with a Profile](#working-with-profiles).

You can also use the **Load Profile** feature of **PTM** to load the
Test Cases of a previously save **Profile** into PTM to run a baseline
set of Test Cases, for example to troubleshoot RDP protocol
implementation changes.

Note that the built-in Test Case results viewing and analysis features
of **PTM** can help you to very quickly identify issues and failures
that occurred during test execution, as described in [Reviewing the Test
Results](#reviewing-the-test-results).

# Test Environment Requirements

This section describes the requirements for the Test Environment in
which the **RDP Client Test Suite** operates. The Test Environment
architecture can consist of two different types, as described
immediately below. The circumstances in which you might choose one over
the other are also described here:

-   **Workgroup Environment** --- you might choose the **Workgroup
    Environment** if you are new to the protocol Test Suites or if you
    want to simplify the setup and environment in which to perform Test
    Cases.

-   **Domain Environment** --- you might need to choose the **Domain
    Environment** if your RDP protocol implementations require Active
    Directory for certain Test Cases.

    You may also choose the **Domain Environment** if you want to run Test
    Cases against your implementation in a more comprehensive environment
    that more closely resembles a real world environment containing a
    Domain Controller.

To review the architectures of these environments, see the [Workgroup
Environment](#workgroup-environment) and [Domain Environment](#domain-environment) topics. Hardware and other
requirements for these environments are described ahead in [Test
Environment Computer
Requirements](#test-environment-computer-requirements).

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image1.png) The major topics covered
in this section include the following:

&emsp;&emsp;[Test Environment Computer Requirements](#test-environment-computer-requirements)

&emsp;&emsp;[Software Installation](#software-installation)

&emsp;&emsp;[Network Configuration](#network-configuration)

&emsp;&emsp;[Verifying Test Environment Connectivity](#verifying-test-environment-connectivity)

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

The section that follows specifies the Test Environment requirements for
Windows-based computers only, which includes **Driver**, **SUT**, and
**Domain Controller** computers. However, it is permissible for the
**SUT** computer to be running a non-Windows operating system version,
although this User Guide provides no information about such
configurations.

Also, please be advised that a **Workgroup Environment** does not
require a domain controller (DC) and that in a **Domain Environment**,
the **DC** can be located on the **SUT** computer.

## Test Environment Computer Requirements

If you run the **RDP Client Test Suite** in a **Domain Environment**, it
should contain the following physical or virtual computers:

-   **Driver computer** --- This computer hosts the **RDP Client Test
    Suite**, from which Test Case execution is launched. It is
    recommended to run the Windows Server 2019 operating system on the
    **Driver** computer. See [Driver Computer](#driver-computer) for
    more requirements information.

-   **SUT computer** --- This computer hosts the RDP protocol
    implementations to be tested by the **RDP Test Suite**. It is
    recommended to run the Windows 10 Client operating system on the
    **SUT** computer. See [System Under Test
    (SUT)](#system-under-test-sut) for more requirements information.

-   **DC computer** --- this computer is configured as a domain
    controller (DC). If this computer is running Windows, it must be the
    Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system version or later. See
    [Domain Controller](#domain-controller) for more requirements
    information.

If you run the **RDP Client Test Suite** in a **Workgroup Environment**,
it should contain the following physical or virtual computers:

-   A **Driver** computer --- same as above.

-   An **SUT** computer --- same as above.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

Test Cases that require the Interactive mode to run do not execute
automatically. If your SUT is running a non-Windows based operating
system, be sure that your installation conforms with the requirements
that apply to your operating system by reviewing the special test
environment requirements in the table below.

The table that follows outlines various constraints that apply in the
Test Environment when executing Test Cases for certain protocols. These
constraints include the need to run the Test Cases against RDPEUSB and
RDPEI implementations in the **Interactive** mode, where some manual
operations must be performed by the user in order to continue test
execution.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

If you are using the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) for execution of Test
Cases, you can set an adapter to the **Interactive** mode as part of
test setup in the PTM Wizard. However, you should only select
**RDPEUSB** or **RDPEI** under the **Protocol** node on the **Filter
Test Cases** page of the PTM Wizard to ensure execution of the specific
Test Cases that require user interaction. Otherwise, Test Cases for
other selected protocols will unnecessarily display interactive dialogs
for each Test Case.

If you are using batch command scripts for execution of Test Cases, you
can set the Interactive mode for the Test Suite in the
RDP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig configuration file, as described in
[Configuring Common Test Suite Mode
Settings](#configuring-common-test-suite-mode-settings).

**Table 2. Test environment special execution requirements**

| **Implementation Test Cases** | **Requirements**                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

## Software Installation

The required prerequisite software specified in this section must be
installed on the **Driver** computer *before* installing the **RDP
Client Test Suite**. Other specified software is optional. As of this
writing, the latest Test Suite version is 4.20.9.0.

### Required Prerequisite Software

The required software for running any Windows Protocol Test Suite is
listed in the *Prerequisites* section of the Windows Protocol Test
Suites
[Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/blob/main/README.md)
documentation on GitHub. You can install the prerequisites with the
**InstallPrerequisites.ps1** PowerShell script that you will find on
[this
page](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/InstallPrerequisites).

In addition, the following is required software:

-   Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later --- enables you to run Test Cases
    with .ps1 script files.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

Windows PowerShell is installed by default with every Windows 7 SP1 and
later operating system and with every Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and
later operating system. However, if you need to ensure that you have the
latest version of PowerShell, go to [Installing PowerShell on
Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7).

### RDP Client Test Suite Software Installation

The **RDP Client Test Suite** software consists of single installation
package (.zip) that you extract separately on both the **Driver
computer** and **SUT computer** with specific installation options for
each.

You will find the official **RDP Test Suite** installers
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/releases)
under the *Assets* topic on GitHub, which includes the
**RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP.zip** and **PTMCli.zip** files.

#### **Other RDP Client Test Suite Acquisition Methods**

You can utilize other options to acquire the **RDP Client Test Suite**,
as described below:

**Cloning a Repository** --- you can clone (copy) the GitHub repository
for the **RDP Client** **Test Suite** to create a locally-synched copy
on your computer, as described in [Cloning a
Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
From the cloned copy of **Test Suite** files, you can use the
**build.ps1** file to build the RDP client, RDP server, and the Protocol
Test Manager separately.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

If you are planning to create your own Test Cases, you might want to
review [Running and Debugging Test Cases With Visual
Studio](#running-and-debugging-test-cases-with-visual-studio) for more
information.

**Building a Test Suite** --- you can also build the **RDP Client Test
Suite** from the open source code with the use of the **build. ps1**
file, which enables you to create the **Test Suite** and **Protocol Test
Manager** components.

*More Information*

**To learn more** about the RDP source code, see the [RDP
source](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP)
for Client and Server components which includes the RDP_client.sln and
RDP_server.sln solution files for creating associated projects in
[Visual Studio 2017
Community](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_community.exe) version. You
can download the source code from [this
page](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/releases).

**To learn more** about creating Test Suites, see *Creating a Test Suite
Manually* in the [Getting Started Guide for
PTF](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProtocolTestFramework/blob/main/docs/PTFUserGuide.md#-creating-a-protocol-test-suite-manually).
The **Protocol Test Framework (PTF)** provides the framework for the
Test environment. You might want to learn more about the framework if
you intend to build your own Test Suite.

### Optional Software

**Protocol Test Manager** **(PTM)** --- provides a graphical user
interface (UI) to facilitate configuration and execution of **RDP Client
Test Suite** Test Cases. Its use is ***highly*
*recommended***, as it automates many of the otherwise manual
configuration steps. The PTM installer (**ProtocolTestManager.msi**) is
located
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/releases)
under the *Assets* topic on GitHub.

For more information about PTM, see the topic [Using Protocol Test
Manager](#using-protocol-test-manager).

**Microsoft® Message Analyzer** (MMA) **---** listed here as an optional
tool given that the Test Cases of themselves neither perform live
captures nor capture integrity verifications during execution. However,
MMA can be helpful with debugging Test Case results, by analyzing ETL
files that are generated by the Test Cases, that is, if you configure
the **NetworkCapture** **Properties** on the **PTF** tab of the
**Configure Test Cases** page in the PTM Wizard during Test Case
configuration. This feature is referred to as Automatic Network
Capturing, which is further described in the [Getting Started Guide for
the Protocol Test
Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProtocolTestFramework/blob/main/docs/PTFUserGuide.md#getting-started-guide-for-the-protocol-test-framework).

In addition, you can use Message Analyzer to capture messages that are
generated by the **Protocol-Test-Suite** message provider that you
select when you are configuring a Message Analyzer session. See
[Capturing RDP Traffic with Microsoft Message
Analyzer](#capturing-rdp-traffic-with-microsoft-message-analyzer) for
additional information.

Lastly, you can use Message Analyzer to capture **Driver** and **SUT**
computer communications as Test Cases are executing, with the use of the
Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture provider.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

November 25 2019 - Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) was retired and
removed from public-facing sites on microsoft.com. A private MMA build
is available for testing purposes; to request it, send an email to
<getmma@microsoft.com>. Note that Message Analyzer will no longer be
supported in this **Test Suite** after **RDP Client Endpoint Test
Suite** version 3.20.1.0.

## Network Configuration

You can run the **RDP Test Suite** in a
[**Workgroup**](#workgroup-environment) or
[**Domain**](#workgroup-environment) environment using either physical
or virtual machines. This User Guide describes the Test Environment
using physical computers only. For information about configuring virtual
machines, see [Create Virtual Machine with Hyper-V on Windows
10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine).

For information about choosing the **Workgroup** or **Domain**
environment in which to run your Test Cases, see [Test Environment
Requirements](#test-environment-requirements).

### Network Infrastructure

A separate test network is required to connect the Test Environment
computer systems. The network infrastructure in which the computers will
reside must meet the following requirements:

-   It must utilize an isolated hub or switch.

-   It must not be connected to a production network or used for any
    other business, personal, private, or communications operation.

-   It must not be connected to the internet.

-   IP addresses and computer names must be assigned to the computers of
    the test network.

-   Specified user credentials must be dedicated to the test network.

-   Network details including computer IP addresses, names, and
    credentials should be saved in a log file or other convenient
    storage.

### Workgroup Environment

The **Workgroup Environment** component computers interact in the
following ways:

-   **Driver computer** --- runs the Test Cases by sending requests over
    the wire in the form of protocol messages.

-   **SUT computer** --- hosts a client implementation of the protocol
    being tested and responds to Test Case requests sent by the **Driver
    computer**.

The following figure illustrates the basic **Workgroup Environment**
architecture:

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image5.png)

#### **Figure 1. Workgroup Environment architecture**

### Domain Environment

The **Domain Environment** component computers interact in the following
ways. Note that a domain controller is a requirement for the **Domain
Environment**.

-   **Driver computer** --- runs Test Cases by sending requests over the
    wire in the form of protocol messages.

-   **SUT computer** --- hosts a client implementation of the protocol/s
    being tested and responds to Test Case requests sent by the **Driver
    computer**.

-   **DC** --- provides functionality in Active Directory Domain
    Services (AD DS) that provides directory service security for Driver
    and SUT Computer and User accounts.

The following figure illustrates the basic **Domain Environment**
architecture.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image6.png)

#### **Figure 2. Domain Environment architecture**

## Verifying Test Environment Connectivity

After you prepare the Test Environment in accordance with earlier topics
of this section, you should verify connectivity between the **Driver
computer** and the **SUT computer**. You should then test connectivity
between all other computers in your Test Environment.

The procedure immediately below provides steps you can follow to check
for connectivity between any two Windows-based computers. For
information about testing connectivity with non-Windows based computers,
see the administrative documentation for your operating system.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

Before performing the procedure that follows, you will need to disable
all active firewalls in the Test Environment by running the following
command string in the Windows command console:

    netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

- **To check connectivity from the Driver computer to a specific computer:**

  1. Right-click the **Start** button and then click **Run**.

  2. In the **Run** dialog, type **cmd** and then click **OK**.

  3. At the Windows command prompt, type **ping** followed by the hostname or IP address of the **SUT** or other computer in the Test Environment, and then press the **Enter** key on the keyboard.

      For example, the command immediately below checks connectivity to an **SUT computer** with hostname SUT01:

          > ping SUT01

      If the connection succeeds, you will see four ping replies at the command line, along with the time in milliseconds that it took to receive the reply from the pinged computer. Otherwise, you will see **Request timed out** messages that indicate that the connection failed.

  4. Repeat step 3 while substituting the name of each computer in your Test Environment for which you will test connectivity to and from every other computer in the environment.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

Do not proceed with **Test Suite** configuration until you confirm that
connectivity succeeded, to eliminate the potential for network
connectivity issues.

        b.  Optionally you can configure group policy for the RDPEGFX AVC 444 feature as specified below:

          ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

          To enable AVC 444 mode in Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 and later versions, you will need to configure *two new Group Policies* via the **Local Group Policy Editor**:

          -   Open the **Local Group Policy Editor** by typing **gpedit.msc** in the Start menu and then press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

          -   Under **Local Computer Policy**, navigate to the following location:

              Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Remote Session Environment

          -   **Enable AVC 444** --- enable this through group policy by performing the steps that follow:

              1. Right-click the policy **Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 Graphics mode for Remote Desktop connections** and select **Edit** to open the **Policy Settings** dialog.

              2. Select **Enabled** and click **OK** to exit the dialog.

                  When enabled on the RDP Server, the H.264/AVC 444 mode will be prioritized when the RDP Client (SUT) and RDP Server (Driver) both support the AVC/H.264 and AVC 444 modes.

                 ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

                  For Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) environments, only full desktop sessions are supported with H.264/AVC 444, as RemoteApp sessions still use the proprietary codecs for now.
          -   **Enable H.264/AVC hardware encoding** --- enable through group policy by performing the steps that follow:

              3.  Right-click the policy **Configure** **H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop connections** and select **Edit** to open the **Policy Settings** dialog.

              4.  Select **Enabled** and click **OK** to exit the dialog.

                  ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

                  This policy enables hardware encoding for AVC/H.264 when used in conjunction with the AVC 444 mode. When enabled, each remote desktop 
                  monitor will use up to one AVC/H.264 encoder on the server. If all AVC/H.264 encoders are in use, the RDP server will automatically
                  fallback to using software encoding.
        
        ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

        The steps that follow are required for the MS-RDPEUSB Test Cases only. If you are not planning to run these Test Cases, skip steps 11, 12.

  11. Navigate to the directory below:

             C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Data

  12. Edit the **Negotiate.rdp**, **DirectTls.rdp**, and **DirectCredSSP.rdp** files by performing the steps that follow for each file:

      a. Right-click the respective RDP file, then click **Edit**.

      b. Select the **Local Resources** tab, click **More...**, and then select the **OSR USB-FX2 LK** check box.

  4.  If Windows PowerShell is not running, start it by typing
    "PowerShell" at the **Start** menu, right-click **Windows
    PowerShell**, and then select **Run as Administrator** in the
    context menu that appears.

  5.  To set the execution policy to Unrestricted, type the following at
    the PowerShell command prompt, and then press the **Enter** key on
    your keyboard:

          Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -F

  6.  To change to the \Scripts directory, type the following at the
    PowerShell command prompt and then press the **Enter**. key on your
    keyboard.

          cd C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Scripts

  7.  To configure the Driver computer, type the following at the
    PowerShell command prompt and then press the **Enter** key on your
    keyboard.

          .\Config-DriverComputer.ps1

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

       After the automation script *.\\Config-DriverComputer.ps1* in the previous step runs, the following occurs:

       -   The script will change the Remote Desktop Service port to 4488 and restart this service (that is, if the value of the **RDPListeningPort** was previously set to 3389 and the Remote Desktop Service is running on the **Driver** computer).

       -   The following files are generated in the C:\\ directory:

           ComputerName.cer

           ComputerName.pfx

The **ComputerName** specification above represents the **Driver** computer name that you configured earlier in the ParamConfig.xml file.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

The certificate **ComputerName**.cer is generated for testing purposes
and is *not* from a trusted Certificate Authority. Therefore, when you
run Test Cases, a dialog may pop up with a warning statement such as:
**The identity of the remote computer cannot be verified. Do you want to
connect anyway?** If so, click **Yes** and then select the **Don\'t ask
me again for connections to this computer** checkbox to prevent this
dialog from displaying again.

However, you can optionally install this certificate on the **SUT**
computer to avoid display of the above warning dialog each time you
attempt a remote **SUT** connection to run your Test Cases, by copying
the ComputerName.cer file to the **SUT** in the steps that follow.

**To install the ComputerName.cer certificate on the SUT computer:**

  1.  On the **SUT** computer, click **Start** and then type "Run", to open the **Run** dialog.

  2.  In the **Run** dialog, type "MMC" and then click **OK**.

  3.  From the **File** menu of the Microsoft Management Console, click **Add/Remove Snap-in.**

  4.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog, select **Certificates** and click **Add**.

  5.  In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog that displays, select the **Computer account** option and click **Next**.

  6.  In the **Select Computer** dialog, accept the default **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)** option and click **Finish**.

  7.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog, click **OK**.

  8.  In the left pane of the Microsoft Management Console, expand the **Certificates (Local Computer)** node, and then expand the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** folder.

  9.  Under **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, right-click the **Certificates** subfolder, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.

  10. On the **Certificate Import Wizard Welcome** page, click **Next**.

  11. On the **File to Import** page of the wizard, click **Browse**. <br/>Browse to the location of the ***ComputerName***.cer file, select the file, then click **Open**.

  12. On the **File to Import** page of the wizard, click **Next**.

  13. On the **Certificate Store** page of the wizard, accept the default selection, and then click **Next**.

  14. On the **Completing the Certificate Import Wizard** page, click **Finish**.

At this point, you can optionally configure Group Policy for the RDPEGFX AVC 444 feature in the steps that follow.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

To enable AVC 444 mode in Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 and later versions, you will need to configure Group Policy in the **Group Policy Editor**. In the procedure that follows, you will set up an AVC 444-supported environment.

  **To configure Group Policy for the RDPEFGX AVC 444 feature:**

  1.  Open the **Local Group Policy Editor** by typing "gpedit.msc" in the **Run** dialog and clicking **OK**.

  2.  Navigate to the location immediately below:

      Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Remote Session Environment

  3.  Enable AVC 444 by doing the following:

      a.  Right-click the **Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop connections** setting and select **Edit** in the context menu that displays.

      b.  In the **Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop connections** settings dialog, select the **Enabled** option, click **Apply**, and then click **OK** to exit the dialog.

  This policy enables hardware encoding for AVC/H.264 when used in conjunction with the AVC 444 mode. When enabled, each remote desktop monitor will use up to one AVC/H.264 encoder on the server. If all AVC/H.264 encoders are in use, the RDP Server will automatically fallback to using software encoding.

## Configuring Non-Windows Test Environment Computers

      To perform the previous step, you may need to consult the administrative documentation for your operating system.

# Configuring the Test Suite

**The RDP Client Test Suite** is installed with default configuration
settings that include property values that are automatically populated
to the RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file during **Test
Suite** installation. It is likely you will need to change some of these
settings to accommodate your Test Environment or if you want to
customize your test runs. If so, you can optionally change the following
settings of the **Test Suite**:

  -   **Unique Test Environment settings** --- including computer names and IP addresses.

  -   **Unique Test Suite settings** --- including the RDP protocol version and target operating system version.

  -   **Timers** --- set time limits on discrete test tasks and on test run duration using the **WaitTime** property.

To modify any configuration settings you will need to open the
RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file from the following
**Driver** computer directory location:

    C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Bin

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image1.png) The tasks for configuring the **RDP Test Suite** are described in the following topics:

  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[Required Configuration Settings](#required-configuration-settings)

  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[Optional Configuration Settings](#optional-configuration-settings)

## Required Configuration Settings

This section describes the configuration settings that are required for
running the **RDP Client Test Suite** Test Cases. Some are required
settings that must be verified in the appropriate configuration file.
For example, you will need to verify the
RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file against the properties and
values described in [Common Required Property
Settings](#common-required-property-settings) that follow.

In other cases, specific property settings are required for particular
RDP protocol extensions, as described in [Property Settings Required for
RDP Protocol Extension Test
Cases](#property-settings-required-for-rdp-protocol-extension-test-cases).
These will also be set in the RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig
file, which you should also verify for valid values.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image8.png)Note

If a data table is not provided in the latter-specified section for a
specific RDP protocol extension, it means that no additional
configuration settings are required for the Test Cases of that protocol
implementation.

# Running Test Cases

The **RDP Test Suite** includes command files that you can use to
execute the Test Cases. Each Test Case verifies a protocol
implementation based on a preconfigured scenario.

The directory location that follows contains the command files for all
the Test Cases:

    C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Batch

You can use any of the following methods to run your Test Cases:

-   Run the Test Cases via PowerShell scripts, as described in [Running
    Test Cases in the Test Suite
    Modes](#running-test-cases-in-the-test-suite-modes).

-   Run the Test Cases using the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) graphical
    user interface (UI), as described in [Using Protocol Test
    Manager](#using-protocol-test-manager).

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image8.png)Note

If you choose the latter option, PTM will need to be installed and
configured to generate a set of Test Cases that you can modify or
execute as is.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image1.png) The major topics covered
in this section include the following:

  &emsp;&emsp;[Viewing Test Results](#viewing-test-results)

  &emsp;&emsp;[Running and Debugging Test Cases With Visual Studio](#running-and-debugging-test-cases-with-visual-studio)

## Test Run Pre-Configuration

Before you actually run the Test Cases, some additional configuration is
required for the **Test Suite** and Test Cases for several protocol
implementations under test, as specified in the topics that follow:

  -   [Configuring Common Test Suite Mode Settings](#configuring-common-test-suite-mode-settings)

  -   [Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEI Events](#configuring-the-test-suite-mode-for-ms-rdpei-events)

  -   [Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEDISP Events](#configuring-the-test-suite-mode-for-ms-rdpedisp-events)

### Configuring Common Test Suite Mode Settings

Test Cases control the RDP client system (**SUT** computer) and typically generate common events such as the following:

**Connection** --- event is triggered by RDP connection setup.

**Disconnection** --- event is triggered by RDP disconnection.

**User input** --- event is triggered from user input, such as keyboard
or mouse input.

These events are generated in the three different Test Suite modes you
can use to control the RDP client, as follows:

-   **PowerShell**

-   **Interactive**

-   **Managed**

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image8.png)Note

If you plan to run Test Cases in PowerShell mode, you must log on with the local Administrator account.

The functions that are provided by these **Test Suite** modes are described in [Running Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes](#running-test-cases-in-the-test-suite-modes).

#### **Controlling the RDP Client on a Windows SUT Computer**

The procedure that follows enables you to configure the **Test Suite**
using one of three different modes to control the RDP client system on a
Windows-based **SUT**.

To configure the Test Suite mode for Windows-based RDP clients:

  1.  Open the RDP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig configuration file from the following directory location:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Bin

  2.  In the .ptfconfig file, locate the \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*powershell*\" name=\"IRdpSutControlAdapter\" scriptdir =\".\" / \> option in the **adapters** node.
      
      Note that the default **Test Suite** mode is **Powershell**.

  3.  To change the **Test Suite** mode from the default, do either of the following as required:

      -   To use the **Interactive** mode, set the xsi:type value to
    "interactive", as in: \< Adapter xsi:type \"*interactive*\"
    name=\"IRdpSutControlAdapter\" / \>.

      -   To use the **Managed** mode, set the xsi:type value to "managed", as
    in: \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*managed*\" name=\"IRdpSutControlAdapter\"
    adaptertype=
    \"Microsoft.Protocols.TestSuites.Rdp.ProtocolBasedRdpSUTControlAdapter\"/ \>
    .

#### **Running Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes**

This section describes the functions of each mode and the common actions that occur when running Test Cases in the different **Test Suite** modes.

**PowerShell Mode** When using the **PowerShell** adapter mode, Test
Cases automatically control the RDP client (**SUT**) via the PowerShell
script that is executing. To customize PowerShell operations in these
scripts, you can modify them, providing that you are familiar with the
technologies involved. Note that the name of each script below specifies
the operation/s that are performed by it:

  -   RDPConnectWithDirectCredSSP.ps1

  -   RDPConnectWithDirectTLS.ps1

  -   RDPConnectWithNegotiationApproach.ps1

  -   RDPConnectWithDirectCredSSPFullScreen.ps1

  -   RDPConnectWithDirectTLSFullScreen.ps1

  -   RDPConnectWithNegotiationApproachFullScreen.ps1

  -   TriggerClientAutoReconnect.ps1

  -   TriggerClientDisconnect.ps1

  -   TriggerClientDisconnectAll.ps1

  -   TriggerInputEvents.ps1

*More Information*

**To learn more** about PowerShell scripting, go to [Starting Windows PowerShell.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7)

**Interactive Mode** When you are using the **Interactive** mode, Test Cases will display dialog boxes that guide you in the manual performance
of test steps, making the implementation of PowerShell scripts unnecessary in this mode.

**Managed Mode** When you are using the **Managed** mode, Test Cases use certain features to control the RDP client system. To facilitate this
mode, an agent must be implemented on the RDP client (**SUT**) in accordance with the [RDP SUT Remote Control Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP/RDPSUTControlAgent/Docs)
documentation. The agent is used to receive **SUT** control requests
from the **Test Suite** and to thereafter facilitate Test Case execution
on the **SUT**.

### Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEI Events

With exception of the common events described earlier in [Test Suite Mode Configuration](#configuring-common-test-suite-mode-settings), the
MS-RDPEI Test Cases must control the RDP client (**SUT** computer) to generate Touch events. The three different modes to control the RDP
client system (SUT) for MS-RDPEI Test Cases are listed immediately below:

  -   **Interactive**

  -   **PowerShell**

  -   **Managed**

The functions that are provided by these **Test Suite** modes are described in [Running MS-RDPEI Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes](#running-ms-rdpei-test-cases-in-the-test-suite-modes).

#### **Choosing a Test Suite Mode Setting for MS-RDPEI Test Cases**

In the procedure that follows you can configure the **Test Suite** to enable the MS-RDPEI Test Cases to control the RDP client system
(**SUT**) using one of the previously listed modes.

To configure the Test Suite mode to enable RDPEI control of the RDP client:

  1.  Open the *RDP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig* configuration file that is located in the following directory location on the **Driver** computer:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Bin

  2.  In the .ptfconfig file, locate the \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*interactive*\" name=\"IRdpeiSUTControlAdapter\" / \> option in the **adapters** node.

      Note that the default mode in this scenario is **Interactive**.

  3.  To change the **Test Suite** mode from the default, do either of the following as required:

      -   To use the **PowerShell** mode, set the xsi:type value to "PowerShell ", as in: \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*PowerShell*\" name=\"IRdpeiSUTControlAdapter\" adaptertype=\"Microsoft.Protocols.TestSuites.Rdpei.RdpeiSUTControlAdapter\"/ \>.

      -   To use the **Managed** mode, set the xsi:type value to "managed", as in: \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*managed*\" name=\"IRdpeiSUTControlAdapter\" adaptertype= \"Microsoft.Protocols.TestSuites.Rdp.ProtocolBasedRdpeiSUTControlAdapter\"/ \>.

#### **Running MS-RDPEI Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes**

This section describes the functions of each mode and the actions that occur when running MS-RDPEI Test Cases in the different **Test Suite** modes.

**Interactive Mode** When you are using the **Interactive** mode, Test Cases will display dialog boxes that guide you in the manual performance of test steps.

**PowerShell Mode** The RDP client system must support MS-RDPRFX features when using the **PowerShell** mode. In the **PowerShell** mode, 
you can trigger Touch events to change the SUT computer screen via PowerShell scripts.

**Managed Mode** When you are using the **Managed** mode, an agent must be implemented on the **SUT**, as described in the [RDP SUT Remote Control
Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP/RDPSUTControlAgent/Docs) documentation. This agent receives **SUT** control requests from the
**Test Suite** and thereafter facilitates Test Case execution on the RDP client (**SUT**).

### Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEDISP Events

With exception of the common events described earlier in [Test Suite Mode Configuration](#configuring-common-test-suite-mode-settings), the
MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases must control the RDP client (**SUT computer**) to generate display events. The three different modes to control the RDP
client for MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases are listed immediately below:

  -   **PowerShell**

  -   **Interactive**

  -   **Managed**

The functions that are provided by these **Test Suite** modes are described in [Running MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes](#running-ms-rdpedisp-test-cases-in-the-test-suite-modes).

#### **Choosing a Test Suite Mode Setting for MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases**

In the procedure that follows you can configure the Test Suite to enable the MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases to control the RDP client (SUT) using one of the previously mentioned modes.

**To configure the Test Suite mode to enable MS-RDPEDISP control of the RDP client:**

  1.  Open the *RDP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig* configuration file from the following directory location:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Bin

  2.  In the .ptfconfig file, locate the \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*powershell*\" name=\"IRdpedispSUTControlAdapter\" scriptdir=\".\" / \> option in the **adapters** node.

      Note that the default mode in this scenario is **Powershell**.

  3.  To change the **Test Suite** mode from the default, do either of the following as required:

      -   To use the **Interactive** mode, set the xsi:type value to "interactive", as in: \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*interactive*\" name=\"IRdpedispSUTControlAdapter\" / \>.

      -   To use the **Managed** mode, set the xsi:type value to "managed", as in: \< Adapter xsi:type=\"*managed*\" name=\"IRdpedispSUTControlAdapter\" adaptertype=\"Microsoft.Protocols.TestSuites.Rdp.ProtocolBasedRdpedispSUTControlAdapter\"/ \>.

#### **Running MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases in the Test Suite Modes**

This section describes the functions of each mode and the actions that occur when running MS-RDPEDISP Test Cases in the different Test Suite modes.

**PowerShell Mode** When using the **PowerShell** mode, Test Cases set up the RDP connection to automatically trigger the **SUT** by
\[PowerShell Core Remoting over SSH\] to connect to the **RDP Client Test Suite** and change the <u>**SUT** display</u> configuration.

**Interactive Mode** When using the **Interactive** mode, Test Cases will display dialog boxes that guide you in the manual performance of test steps.

**Managed Mode** When using the **Managed** mode, an agent must be implemented on the **SUT** computer, as described in the [RDP SUT Remote Control Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP/RDPSUTControlAgent/Docs)
documentation. This agent receives **SUT** control requests from the **Test Suite** and thereafter facilitates Test Case execution on the RDP client (**SUT**).

## Running Verification Tests

The **RDP Client Test Suite** includes a set of basic tests known as build verification tests (BVTs). The BVTs are a set of Scenario S1 Test
Cases, as specified in the [RDP Client Test Design Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/blob/main/TestSuites/RDP/Client/docs/RDP_Overview_ClientTestDesignSpecification.md),
that together perform verification tests that confirm whether the **Test Suite** is properly configured and ready to run Test Cases. To run Scenario S1 Test Cases, execute each command file specified in the table
that follows.

You will find the BVT command files (.ps1) in the directory location below on the **Driver** computer:

    C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Batch\

Note that the command files (.ps1) in this directory are accessible from a directory shortcut named **Run Test Cases Scripts** on your **Driver** computer desktop, 
which is created during the **Test Suite** installation process.

**Table 17. Verification tests and executable command files on the Driver computer**

        Read the **Help Message** in the dialog for instructions on manually performing the specified operations. To further accommodate the instructions, additional explanations are indicated below:

        -   On the **SUT computer**, start a remote desktop (RDP) connection to
            the **Driver** computer using the negotiation-based approach (see
            [MS-RDPBCGR section 5.4.2.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/db98be23-733a-4fd2-b086-002cd2ba02e5))
            and specify either the TLS, Cress, or RDP standard security protocol to secure the RDP session. Once you start the RDP connection
            successfully, on the driver computer, input \'Y\' and press \"Enter\" key on the console. Otherwise, if you want to abort the
            case, input \'N\' and press \"Enter\" key on the console.The test case will continue to run if you press \"Enter\" key, otherwise, it
            will end and fail.

            *More Information* 
            <br/>**To learn more** about using the RDP standard security and RDP enhanced security, see MS-RDPBCGR sections [5.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/8e8b2cca-c1fa-456c-8ecb-a82fc60b2322)
            and [5.4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/592a0337-dc91-4de3-a901-e1829665291d).

        -   After the RDP connection successfully starts, then in the **RDPConnectWithNegotiationApproach** dialog on the **Driver** computer, specify a non-negative number (such as 0) as the **Return
            Value** in the **Action Results** field, and then click the **Succeed** button. Otherwise, if you cannot start the RDP connection, specify a negative number (such as -1) as the **Return
            Value** in the **Action Results** field, specify the error message in the **Failure Message** field, and then click **Fail**.

  3.  After the formerly running **Test Case** finishes, observe that the following dialog displays on the **Driver** computer:

       ![Text Description automatically generated](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image12.jpeg)
         #### **Figure 4. TriggerClientDisconnectAll dialog**

         According to the **Help Message**, you will do:

      -   On the SUT, close all the RDP connections to driver computer.

          On the driver computer, input \'Y\' on the console and press \"Enter\" key if you close all the RDP connections successfully. Otherwise, if you want to abort the case, input \'N\' and press \"Enter\" key on the console.

## Example: Running RDPEI Test Cases in Interactive Mode

This section provides an example of how to run RDPEI Test Cases in **Interactive** mode. However, note that the RDP connection is
configured in **PowerShell** mode. To test this example on the **Driver** computer, perform the procedure below and follow the interactive instructions.

**To run RDPEI test cases in an Interactive mode, example:**

  1.  On the **Driver** computer, configure the **Test Suite** mode to **Interactive**, as described in [Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEI Events](#configuring-the-test-suite-mode-for-ms-rdpei-events).

  2.  On the **Driver** computer, run the following Test Case:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Batch\RunTestCasesByFilter.ps1 -Filter "Name= Rdpei_TouchInputTest_Positive_SingleTouchEvent"

       When the Test Case begins running, the **SUT** computer initiates a remote desktop (RDP) connection to the **Driver** computer 
       using the negotiation-based approach (see [MS-RDPBCGR section 5.4.2.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/db98be23-733a-4fd2-b086-002cd2ba02e5)),
       and specifies either the TLS, CredSSP, or RDP standard security protocol to secure the RDP session.

   3.  Observe that the following RDP **Negotiate** screen displays on the **SUT** computer:

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image13.png)

         #### **Figure 5. RDP Touch screen prompt**

   4.  In the RDP **Negotiate** screen, manually touch the screen as requested.

   5.  Observe that the following response occurs in the **Negotiate** screen shown in the figure below, as an indication of Test Case success.

   6. When the Test Case is done, wait until the **SUT** computer disconnects from the **Driver** computer, which signifies the end of the Test Case.

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image14.png)

         #### **Figure 6. RDP Touch screen response**

## Viewing Test Results

The **RDP Client Test Suite** test results output is located in different directory paths depending on the method used to execute the
Test Cases. The table that follows identifies the test mode and the related directory locations from where you can view test results data:

**Table 19. Test Case results directories**

| **Test Mode**                              | **Test Results Directory**                  |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

For further information about test log settings, see the [PTF User Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProtocolTestFramework/blob/main/docs/PTFUserGuide.md).

## Running and Debugging Test Cases with Visual Studio

If you are creating your own Test Cases, typically in a C\# project, you can use the RDP_Client.sln solution file for Visual Studio to create a
project for your environment in which you can run and debug your Test Cases. This solution file is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP/Client/src)
on GitHub.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

To proceed with Visual Studio debugging, you will need to have created a Visual Studio project for the **RDP Test Suite** from the RDP source
code, as described earlier in [Other RDP Test Suite Acquisition Methods](#other-rdp-client-test-suite-acquisition-methods). If you did not yet acquire the source code, do the following:

**To acquire the RDP Client Test Suite source code files, perform the following steps:**

  1.  Locate the **RDP Test Suite** code on GitHub in [this directory](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main).

  2.  Download the **RDP Test Suite** files from all the folders in the previously specified directory location on GitHub, to a local directory location such as the following:

           C:\RDPTestSuiteSource\

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note
        <br/>You should be able to click the **Code** button at the formerly specified GitHub directory and download a .zip file with all the RDP directories required for cloning.

To proceed with running and debugging your custom Test Cases, perform the steps that follow:

**To run and debug test cases using an RDP Client Test Suite installation built from source code:**

  1.  On the **Driver computer**, use Microsoft® Visual Studio® to open the RDP_Client.sln from the path you specified in the last procedure. Look under the .../TestSuites/RDP/Client/src subdirectory
    for the .sln file.

  2.  In the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer** window, right-click the **Solution** '**RDP_Client'** and select **Build Solution** from the context menu that appears.

  3.  Configure the RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig and RDP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig files as described in [Configuring the
    Test Suite](#configuring-the-test-suite). You can locate the .ptfconfig files in the following directory location, providing that
    you downloaded the **RDP Test Suite** files in accordance with the last procedure:

          C:\RDPTestSuiteSource\WindowsProtocolTestSuites\TestSuites\RDP\Client\src\TestSuite\

  4.  From the Visual Studio **Test** menu, navigate to **Windows** and click **Test Explorer** to open the list of Test Cases and then select the name/s of the Test Case/s that you want to run and debug.

  5.  While Test Cases are running, monitor the VS Output Window and debug errors and warnings as they appear.

# Using Protocol Test Manager

Protocol Test Manager (PTM) is a graphical front-end for all Windows
protocol **Test Suites**, which means that you can configure the **RDP
Client Test Suite** environment, execute the Test Cases, and thereafter
analyze all test results right from the PTM user interface (UI). The PTM
also has a **Configuration Wizard** that guides you through all the
review, configuration, and test execution processes. When test execution
is complete, the PTM provides several formats in which to view test
results data and other features with which you can conduct test results
analysis.

With the use of PTM, you can simplify detection and configuration of the
test environment and you can create your own customized test
configuration arrangements. The list that follows summarizes a
combination of tasks, some that PTM automates and others that PTM
exposes for you to perform:

-   PTM automates the following tasks:

    -   Reviewing the execution environment (**Domain** or **Workgroup**).

    -   Providing the **Auto-Detect** process to detect, inspect, and
        validate the **SUT computer** environment configuration and
        capabilities for test readiness.

    -   Creating a default set of Test Cases, based on the assessed **SUT**
        environment.

-   PTM exposes the features that enable you to do the following:

    -   Modify the default output of the **Auto-Detection** process, by selecting/unselecting (filtering) Test Cases to create a
        unique test configuration that will focus on a specific set of test results.

    -   Review and optionally configure Test Case properties.

    -   Trigger execution of a set of Test Cases.

    -   Save a test case **Profile** that preserves a specific Test Case
        configuration so that you can re-run it at any time by loading
        the **Profile** Test Cases into the PTM, or by using the
        PTMCli.exe command line tool to execute the Test Cases.

    -   Analyze the results of Test Case execution.

  &emsp;&emsp;[Running the Protocol Test Manager](#running-the-protocol-test-manager)

  &emsp;&emsp;[Other PTM Configuration and Execution Methods](#other-ptm-configuration-and-execution-methods)

## Installing the Protocol Test Manager

If you have not done so already, you will need to install the Protocol
Test Manager (PTM) now. Ensure that the **RDP Test Suite** and all of
its dependencies are installed before you do so, as described in
[Software Installation](#software-installation). When ready, install the
PTM on your **Driver computer** with the official
**ProtocolTestManager.msi**, as follows:

**To install the Protocol Test Manager:**

  1.  From the **Driver** computer, navigate
    [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/releases)
    to locate the **ProtocolTestManager.msi** under the *Assets* topic
    on GitHub.

  2.  From the **Driverr** compute, double-click the
    **ProtocolTestManager.msi** to run the installer.

  3.  Follow the installer instructions to complete the installation.

## Running the Protocol Test Manager

During PTM installation, a shortcut to the application is created on
your desktop. Thereafter, to start the PTM and perform the test
environment configuration and Test Case execution processes, complete
the following steps:

**To run the Protocol Test Manager**

  1.  Double-click the **Protocol Test Manager** icon/shortcut on your desktop.

        The **Select Test Suite** tab displays several Test Suites including  **File Sharing**, **Security**, **RDP**, and so on. Note that the only
          active **Test Suite** on the opening page of the PTM Wizard is **RDP**, as indicated by the live **Run** and **Configuration Wizard** links on the right side of the UI.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image17.png)

         #### **Figure 7. Protocol Test Manager: Launching the Configuration Wizard for RDP Client Test Suite**

         You need to select a protocol test suite as following.

         #### **Figure 8. Protocol Test Manager: Selecting RDP Client Test Suite Folder Path**

  2.  Click the **Configuration Wizard** link to begin the **Test Suite** configuration process.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

      If this is for first time use, click the **Configuration Wizard** link
      to start the **RDP Test Suite** configuration process. Thereafter,
      while no Test Cases are running and if the **Test Suite** requires no
      further configuration changes, you can simply click **Run** to execute
      the existing (last) configuration of Test Cases while still retaining
      the existing **Test Suite** configuration settings.

      At any time, you can resume configuration of the **Test Suite**, by clicking **Configuration Wizard**.

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image18.png)

         #### **Figure 9. Protocol Test Manager: Reviewing the RDP Test Suite family of protocols**

  3.  Read the information presented on the **Test Suite Introduction** page of the PTM Wizard and click the **Deployment Guide** link to
      review general information about the test environment in which you will run your Test Cases.

  4.  Click **Next** to display the **Choose configuration method** page of the PTM Wizard.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

      It is unnecessary to click the **Configure Environment** link after reviewing the test environment, given that you will have already performed the indicated procedures earlier in this User Guide.

  5.  On the **Choose configuration method** page of the PTM Wizard shown in the figure that follows, click **Run Auto-Detection** to start
      the process of retrieving the capabilities of the SUT implementation (also click **Yes** to the **Warning** message that displays). The retrieved capabilities are used to automatically configure the
      **Test Suite** and select a default set of Test Cases for the assessed environment.

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Caution

        Unless you are adept at Microsoft RDP testing technologies and you understand how to assess the **SUT** environment with respect to
        manually choosing the correct Test Cases and configuring their properties, you are advised to not use the **Do Manual Configuration**
        option on the **Choose configuration method** page of the PTM Wizard. Also note that the **Load Profile** option is discussed in further
        detail ahead in [Working with a Profile](#working-with-profiles).

      *More Information*
  
      **To learn more** about the **Do Manual Configuration** feature, see [Manually Configuring Test Cases and Properties](#manual-configuration-of-test-cases-and-properties).

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image19.png)

      #### **Figure 10. Protocol Test Manager: Choosing the configuration method**

      After you click **Run Auto-Detection**, the **Auto-Detection** page of the PTM Wizard displays, as shown in the figure that follows.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image20.png)

      #### **Figure 11. Protocol Test Manager: Verifying SUT connection parameters**

6.  On the **Auto-Detection** page of the PTM Wizard, verify that the values for such items as **SUT Name**, **SUT User Name**, **SUT
    Password**, and **Agent Listen Port** are correct in your environment, to ensure that the PTM can connect with the **SUT
    computer** and perform an accurate assessment of SUT capabilities.

7.  When verification is complete, click the **Detect** button in the lower-right sector of the **Auto-Detection** page (changes to the **Cancel** button, as in the previous figure).
    <br/>As the detection process proceeds, you will see the **Pending** indications beneath the data entry fields change to **Finished** as detection progress continues.

8.  After the initial detection process completes, click **Next** to display the **Detection Result** page of the PTM Wizard, as shown in the figure that follows:

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image21.png)

      #### **Figure 12. Protocol Test Manager: Reviewing the Detection Results**

9.  In the **Detection Result** page of the Wizard, review the data that appears under the **Protocols Support Info** 
    and **Feature Support Info** nodes to ensure that the supported protocols and features are as you expect.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Tip

    If there are unexpected unsupported entities in the detection results,
    you may want to consider re-examining the SUT configuration processes
    that you performed earlier in this User Guide, for example, in
    [Configuring the Test Suite](#configuring-the-test-suite).
    <br/>Otherwise, click **Next** to display the **Filter Test** **Cases** page of the PTM Wizard.

10. From the **Filter Test Cases** page of the PTM Wizard shown in the figure that follows, select different combinations of Test Cases
    from the categories that follow. However, you will need to select at least one of the sub-nodes in the **Priority** category and one
    in the **Protocol** category to activate and display associated Test Cases for a test run:

    -   **Protocol** --- contains the RDP protocols under test (**SUT** implementation).

    -   **Priority** --- enables you to specify the type of tests to run (**BVT** or **NonBVT**).

    -   **Enable Supported Feature** --- activates Test Cases for supported features discovered in **Auto Detect**.

    -   **Specific Requirements** --- enables you to specify the Interactive mode of testing described earlier in [Test Run Pre-Configuration](#test-run-pre-configuration).

    Each time you select a Test Case node, the total number of selected Test Cases appears just to the right of the **Selected Test Cases** label. 
    Take note that if a Test Case belongs to multiple categories, it is listed in each category.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

    If the detection status of a feature or protocol is not supported, it will appear in italics and will provide a tool tip message to that
    effect, that is, if you mouse-hover over that particular component. See *RDPEUSB* in the figure below as an example.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image22.png)

      #### **Figure 13. Protocol Test Manager: Selecting (filtering) Test Cases**

11. Create a hypothetical Test Case configuration in the steps that follow:

    a.  In the four categories described in the previous step, unselect the **Select All** node in each category.

    b.  In the **Protocol** category, select a protocol such as **RDPBCGR**.

    c.  In the **Priority** category, select either the **BVT** or **NonBVT** check box.

    d.  Observe that the Test Cases that apply to the selected protocol display in the Test Cases list view along with 
        the number of tests in the **Selected Test Cases** label, as similar to the previous figure. If you selected **BVT**, you will run the basic build verification
        Test Cases for the **Protocol** you selected, as described in [Running Verification Tests](#running-verification-tests), otherwise, the **NonBVT** tests for 
        that **Protocol** will apply to the test run.

    e.  Click **Next** to display the **Configure Test Cases** page of the Wizard, as shown in the figure that follows.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image23.png)

      #### **Figure 14. Protocol Test Manager: Reviewing/configuring Test Case properties**

12. On the **Configure Test Cases** page, click the **Default Group** to
    display the RDP properties that you verified (or revised) in
    [Configuring the Test Suite](#configuring-the-test-suite).

13. Scroll through the property values to ensure they are correct.

14. Select the **PTF** group to display the **Network Capture**
    properties that enable your Test Cases to create event trace log
    (ETL) data that you can analyze with a protocol analysis tool such
    as Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA).
    <br/>Note that if you want to utilize this feature, you will need to have
    installed MMA as described in [Optional Software](#optional-software).
    If you want to proceed, follow these sub-steps:

    a.  Click the **NetworkCapture** node to display the data entry fields,
    if not displayed already.

    b.  Set the **StopRunningOnError** field to false, if it is not already
    set that way.

    c.  Ensure that the **CaptureFileFolder** path is set to
    "C:\\RDPClient_CaptureFileDirectory" and also verify that this
    folder actually exists on the **Driver** computer.
    If it does not, then please create it in the specified location.

    d.  Set the **Enabled** field to true.

    e.  When complete, click **Next** to display the **Configure Adapters**
    page of the Wizard, as shown in the figure that follows.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image24.png)

      #### **Figure 15. Protocol Test Manager: Configuring the Adapters**

15. In the **Configure Adapters** page of the PTM Wizard, observe the following Adapters and the indicated topics to which the adapter settings correspond:

    **Table 20. Control Adapter configuration setting instructions**

    |**Adapter Name**               |**Related Topic**|
    |-------------------------------|-----------------|
    | Basic RDP SUT Control Adapter | [Configuring Common Test Suite Mode Settings](#configuring-common-test-suite-mode-settings)|
    | RDPEI SUT Control Adapter     | [Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEI Events](#configuring-the-test-suite-mode-for-ms-rdpei-events)|
    | RDPEDISP SUT Control Adapter  | [Configuring the Test Suite Mode for MS-RDPEDISP Events](#configuring-the-test-suite-mode-for-ms-rdpedisp-events)|
    |                               |                 |

16. Click the drop-down arrow for each Adapter and select the
    appropriate mode setting from the following options, while noting
    that **PowerShell** is the default setting:

    -   **Interactive** --- the Interactive adapter displays a dialog that enables you to manually perform operations and to thereafter enter results in the dialog.

    -   **Managed** --- the Managed adapter uses managed code to implement the adapter's methods.

    -   **PowerShell** --- the PowerShell adapter uses PowerShell scripts to implement the adapter\'s methods.

    -   **Shell** --- an additional option that enables Unix shell scripts to implement the adapter\'s methods.

    *More Information*
    <br/>**To learn more** about adapter settings, see the topic [Test Run Pre-Configuration](#test-run-pre-configuration).

17. When complete, click **Next** to display the **Run selected test cases** page of the PTM Wizard, as shown in the figure that follows.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image25.png)

    #### **Figure 16. Protocol Test Manager: Running the selected Test Cases**

18. Observe that the following options in the lower sector of the UI are available for running Test Cases from the **Run Selected Test Cases** tab of the PTM:

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

    Do not execute Test Cases** **now! Only execute the tests from [Running the Test Cases](#running-the-test-cases) ahead**.

    -   **Run All** --- clicking this link will run all Test Cases.

        If you select this option, all Test Cases that exist under the **Not
        Run** checkbox on the **Run Selected Test Cases** tab of PTM will be
        executed, whether the Test Cases are actually selected. These Test
        Cases are the ones that you selected/filtered earlier on the **Filter
        Test Cases** tab of PTM and therefore appear on the **Run Selected
        Test Cases** tab.

        This option *does not* *mean* you will be executing *all* the default
        Test Cases returned from auto-detection of the SUT configuration, but
        rather the *set* of Test Cases you filtered from the default set.

    -   **Run Selected Cases** --- clicking this link will execute the *selected* Test Cases only.

If you are ready to run your Test Cases, go to the procedure: [Running the Test Cases](#running-the-test-cases). Otherwise, proceed to the next
topic for additional information about indications you can expect during Test Case execution.

### Monitoring Test Case Execution

After you start Test Cases execution in [Running the Test Cases](#running-the-test-cases) ahead, two command shells will display
with test execution data, which includes success and failure indications. After execution is complete, you can view Test Case logs to
the right of the Test Case list view, by selecting any Test Case in the list view.

As the tests are running in PTM, you can view high level results in the following three categories. As Test Case execution progresses, you can
observe these categories being incrementally updated:

  -   **Passed** --- provides a dynamic indication of how many tests have passed, out of the total number selected for execution.

  -   **Failed** --- provides a dynamic indication of how many tests have failed, out of the total number selected for execution.

  -   **Inconclusive** --- indicates the tests that were inappropriate, unsupported, or the result of misconfiguration in the test environment.

      For example, if a property set in the > RDPTestSuite.Deployment.ptfconfig file is incorrectly configured, or a Test Case conflicts with an unexpected or invalid property value, that Test Case can finish as Inconclusive.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

In the PTM, you can drag the separator between the Test Case list view and the right-hand side output log pane to adjust the width of the window for better viewing.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

If any of the core/preconfigured Test Cases in a test environment do not
support certain features, errors will appear in the command console and
PTM with respect to methods that failed when attempting to test those
features. Notwithstanding errors from actual failures, you can avoid
this outcome by running only the Test Cases that support the features of
your environment.

*More Information*

**To learn more** about Test Cases and the tests they perform, review
their descriptions in the *Test Scenarios* section of the [RDP Client Test Design Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/blob/main/TestSuites/RDP/Client/docs/RDP_Overview_ClientTestDesignSpecification.md#2.2.1).

### Running the Test Cases

To run your Test Cases, perform the steps of the procedure that follows.

**To run the Test Cases**:

  1.  On the **Run Selected Test Cases** page of the **PTM** wizard,
      select the **Not Run** check box if it is not already selected and
      then click the **Run Selected Cases** link below the Test Cases list
      view, as shown in the figure that follows.

      Given that the **Not Run** checkbox is selected, all the Test Cases
      under the checkbox are also selected and will run when you click the
      **Run Selected Cases** link, as described earlier in this section.

  2.  To prevent any Test Case in the selected test set from running,
      click the down-arrow to the left of the **Not Run** checkbox and
      unselect one or more tests to exclude them from running, as shown in
      the figure that follows.

      You can also run Test Cases from the context menu that appears when
      you right-click in the Test Case list view itself. The context menu
      provides commands such as **Run Selected Cases** and **Run All
      Cases**, as shown in the following figure. In addition, you can select
      the **Uncheck All** command to uncheck all selected Test Cases.

      Whether you select the **Run Selected Cases** or the **Run All Cases**
      context menu command, the effect will be as described
      earlier. In addition, if you select the **Uncheck
      All** context menu command, then no Test Cases will run afterwards
      when you click the **Run Selected Cases** context menu command.
      However, if you select the **Run All** context menu command
      afterwards, all Test Cases listed under the **Not Run** checkbox will
      execute.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image27.png)

      #### **Figure 18. Protocol Test Manager: Context menu commands for Test Case execution**

3.  To display the context menu shown in the figure immediately above,
    click the down-arrow to the left of the **Not Run** check box in the
    Test Cases list view, then right-click the list of tests to display
    the menu. If Test Case execution is currently *not* *in progress*,
    click the **Run Selected Cases** command in the context menu to
    begin test execution.

4.  While the Test Cases are executing, observe the indications that
    appear in the **Passed**, **Failed**, and **Inconclusive** check box
    labels as described in [Monitoring Test Case
    Execution](#monitoring-test-case-execution).

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

    You can also view the results of Test Case execution in the command consoles that host test execution. However, note that the PTM makes
    the results more accessible and understandable through categorization, summaries, status indicators, and built-in logs, as described just ahead.

### Reviewing the Test Results

After Test Case execution is complete, you can view the details of the
execution results. The results that are likely to be of the most
interest are the Test Cases that failed. The PTM provides a number of
tools that can quickly point you to what the causes of a failure might
be.

The PTM enables you to utilize various status indicators, stack
messages, error messages, icons, logs, and other highlighted indications
that can pinpoint the cause of failures very rapidly. In addition, you
can launch an HTML-based display of output results that independently
reproduces the PTM output data displays.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

As a developer who is using a Microsoft Test Suite to test real-world
protocol implementations, you can utilize the PTM analysis features to
verify the outcome of custom Test Case execution as **Passed**,
**Failed**, or **Inconclusive**. Each of these indications can be of
equal importance when it comes to resolving issues that are critical to
a successfully functioning protocol.

#### **Test Results Output Status Indicators**

Some of the status indicators that you will encounter as you review your
test results are described in the table that follows:

**Table 21. Test results status indicators**

| **Status Indicator** | **Description**      | **UI Location**      |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Initial test results status summary | Results display in either of these configurations:The number of Test Cases that passed, failed, or were inconclusive. The number of Test Cases that executed for specific RDP operations, where the number of tests that were run are identified. | 1.	The first results display configuration is shown as expandable **Passed**, **Failed**, and **Inconclusive** results category check box nodes in the left-hand Test Cases pane of the PTM. Appears when selecting the **Outcome** item in the **Group by** drop-down list. <br/>2.	The second results display configuration is broken down into the various categories of RDP operations or protocols being tested, for example **ServerRedirection** or **StaticVirtualChannel**, where the number of Test Cases associated with the operation or protocol is indicated, while the number of tests having issues is specified by a **Checked** indicator. Appears when selecting the Category item in the **Group by** drop-down list. |
| **Start Time** and **End Time** | Exposes the overall duration of Test Case execution. | Appears in the upper left sector of the right-hand test results pane for any selected Test Case in any results category. |
| **Result**                     | The results category for a particular Test Case, for example: **Passed**, **Failed**, or **Inconclusive**. | Appears in the upper left sector of the right-hand test results pane for any selected Test Case in any results category. |
| Test Case functionality | The general purpose of a Test Case. | Typically described in a **[Comment]** tag that appears in the [StandardOut](#standardout-category-status-indicators) category of results. |
| Debug output data | Informative data that is displayed in tags in the [StandardOut](#standardout-category-status-indicators) category of results. | Includes data that displays in information tags such as the following: <br/>&emsp;-	[TestInProgress] <br/>&emsp;-	[Comment] <br/>&emsp;-	[Debug] <br/>&emsp;-	[CheckPoint] <br/>&emsp;-	[CheckSucceeded] <br/>&emsp;-	[CheckFailed] <br/>&emsp;-	 [TestStep] <br/>&emsp;-	[TestPassed] <br/>&emsp;-	[TestFailed] <br/>See [StandardOut Category Status Indicators](#standardout-category-status-indicators) for descriptions. |
| Error output data | Holds data that you can analyze to identify the source of Test Case failures. | Appears in the [ErrorStackTrace](#errorStackTrace-category) and [ErrorMessage](#errorMessage-category) categories of results. |
| Test case status | ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image28.png) — indicates the executed Test Case status as **Passed**. <br/> ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image29.png) — indicates the executed Test Case status as **Inconclusive**. <br/>![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image30.png) — indicates the Test Case status is **Not Run**. <br/> ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image31.png)— indicates the executed Test Case status as **Failed**.                | These indicators appear immediately to the right of the Test Case check box after test execution, to indicate the test result status; the exception is the blue **Not Run** status indicator, which appears prior to test execution and persists this status if a Text Case did not run.  |
|                  |                          |                      |

*This same information is repeated as the text of a hyperlink that appears in the upper-right-hand sector of the PTM. This hyperlink opens an HTML-based display of test results.

The figure that follows is an example of the **Category** grouping for
Test Cases (grouped by RDP operations that contain the Test Cases), and
also shows the three results output categories for test analysis in the
right-hand pane of the PTM.

Note that in the expanded **RDP7.1** test result node below, **RDPEUSB**
errors occurred because it is an unsupported feature, as described
earlier in the Auto detect portion of [Running the Protocol Test Manager](#installing-the-protocol-test-manager).

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image32.png)

#### **Figure 19. Protocol Test Manager: RDP Category grouping \| Expanded ErrorMessage result**


#### **StandardOut Category Status Indicators**

Some of the low-level indicators of the **StandardOut** category that
are directly associated with the incremental step-by-step record of how
the tests were conducted, along with interim results, are described as
below. Note that the **\[CheckSucceeded\]**, **\[Comment\]**, and
**\[Debug\]** information tags are shown in the figure that follows.

**\[TestStep\]** --- highlighted in **Blue**. Describes the details of a
particular step in a Test Case.

**\[Debug\]** --- no highlighting, plain text. Describes actions that
were taken during a portion of a Test Case, such as connecting to a
server over TCP, as part of the **\[TestStep\]** in which it exists.

**\[Checkpoint\]** --- no highlighting, plain text. Provides values at
key points during a test that can elicit insights into the causes of an
imminent failure. Can also include pointers to protocol specification
sections that define acceptable data type values and ranges, to assist
in troubleshooting.

**\[CheckSucceeded\]** --- highlighted in **Green**. Indicates that the
actions taken at a particular check point of a **\[TestStep\]** were
successful.

**\[CheckFailed\]** --- highlighted in **Red**. Indicates that the
actions taken at a particular check point were unsuccessful.

**\[TestPassed\]** --- highlighted in **Green**. Indicates that the Test
Case passed.

**\[TestFailed\]** --- highlighted in **Red**. Indicates that the Test
Case failed.

**\[Comment\]** --- no highlighting, plain text. Provides other
information such as brief descriptions of Test Case actions, states,
values, and so on.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

Most of the above information tags are also returned from the
**Protocol-Test-Suite** message provider that you can use to detect
local RDP messages in a Message Analyzer trace session, as described in
[Capturing RDP Traffic with Message
Analyzer](#capturing-rdp-traffic-with-microsoft-message-analyzer)

The figure that follows shows the **BVT** category of tests and the
expanded **StandardOut** node with several of the above information tags
displayed. In the case of the selected
**BVT_AutoReconnect_PositiveTest** in the figure, the
**\[CheckSucceeded\]** tag verifies that the **SUT** should support the
**Auto-Reconnect** feature.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image33.png)

#### **Figure 20. Protocol Test Manager: RDP BVT test category \| StandardOut node**

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

You can display Test Cases that meet specified search criteria by typing
a search term in the **Find** text box and pressing the **Enter** key on
your keyboard.

**Test Results in HTML Format** If you click the link in the upper-right
sector of the PTM UI, an HTML-based display of test results appears with
various options for reviewing the results, as shown in the next figure.

In the **Case List** pane of the HTML display in the figure, you have
the following options for grouping the Test Cases to expose different
analysis perspectives of the data, as follows:

  -   **None** --- provides a flat list of Test Cases that are listed in
    ascending sorted order.

  -   **Test Results** --- groups the Test Case results in **Failed**,
    **Inconclusive**, and **Passed** nodes.

  -   **Category** --- groups the Test Case results under various
    operation or feature names.

  -   **Class** --- groups the Test Case results in nodes that contain the
    name of the protocols under test.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image34.png)

#### **Figure 21. Protocol Test Manager: Case List HTML test results display**

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

You can also search for Test Cases by typing a search term in the
**Keyword** text box and clicking the **Go** button. You can also filter
the **StandardOut** results via a **Log Filter**.

#### **ErrorStackTrace Category**

Provides a visual indication of the call stack where a failure occurred.
The Error message itself displays at the end of the **ErrorStackTrace**
information, which extends into the **ErrorMessage** category.

#### **ErrorMessage Category** 

Provides details and comments that can identify the source of the error
event and the conditions that existed when the error event occurred. As
an aid to further inspection of the error event, the PTM can provide
comments that point you to the related sections of a Microsoft RDP
protocol specification, which may shed light on what the underlying
failure may be related to, such as expected states, values, parameters,
event data, and so on.

## Other PTM Configuration and Execution Methods

This section provides a brief overview of the manual configuration of
Test Cases and properties and the disadvantages of proceeding without
the **Auto-Detect** feature of the PTM.

This section also discusses how to create a **Profile** that
encapsulates a chosen set of Test Cases, so that you can re-run such a
set of tests on demand. One such use of the **Profile** feature might be
to compare test results before and after the following:

  -   Changes to the RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file.

  -   Revisions to PowerShell script files (.ps1).

  -   Code fixes in one or more Test Cases (providing that you are creating your own Test Cases).

You could also perform periodic re-runs of Test Cases to achieve other
goals that are specific to your custom environment.

Lastly, this section describes how to run Test Cases from a command line
tool known as PTMCli.exe.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image1.png)The following topics in this section cover the concepts that are described above:

&emsp;&emsp;[Manual Configuration of Test Cases and Properties](#manual-configuration-of-test-cases-and-properties)

&emsp;&emsp;[Working with Profiles](#working-with-profiles)

&emsp;&emsp;[Executing Test Cases from the Command Line](#executing-test-cases-from-the-command-line)

### Manual Configuration of Test Cases and Properties

To perform manual configuration of Test Cases, you will need to click
the **Do Manual Configuration** option on the **Configure Method** page
of the PTM Wizard. This takes you directly to the **Filter Test Cases**
page and by-passes the use of **Auto-Detection**.

By doing so, you will be unable to take advantage of the automatic
detection and assessment of the **SUT computer** environment so that you
can obtain a recommended set of default Test Cases to run, in addition
to automatically-specified Test Case properties. As a result of working
in this mode of operation, you will need to do the following manually:

-   Select a set of Test Cases for configuration and execution.

-   Configure the Test Case properties.

-   Configure the control Adapters.

-   Select the final set of Test Cases to execute.

-   Click **Run Selected Cases** to begin test execution.

When you are working on the basis of manual Test Case selection and
property configuration, you should be very familiar with which Test
Cases will support your **SUT** environment, the features that are
supported in the **SUT** environment, and the property values necessary
for successful Test Case execution. A lack of knowledge in this regard
could result in errors that occur because of unsupported features or
improper/missing property values, thus hindering the primary goal of
detecting errors that are related to actual Test Case failures.

### Working with Profiles

This section describes how to save a **Profile** and how to use it to
run the Test Cases the **Profile** contains from the **Load Profile**
option in PTM.

#### **Saving a Profile**

After you complete test execution based on a particular Test Case
configuration in [Running the Test Cases](#running-the-test-cases), you
have the option to use the PTM to save the configuration as a
**Profile** that you can re-run on demand simply by locating
the **Profile** in a specified directory and loading it directly into
the PTM or by executing it from the command line. Thereafter, you can
analyze the data in HTML or text log format.

In order to utilize a **Profile** in the stated manner, it is
recommended that you run the **RDP Client Test Suite** at least once and
then save a **Profile** that extracts the selected Test Cases and
related configuration information.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

If you want to save specific Test Cases in a **Profile**, you must
select them before your save the **Profile**, otherwise the **Profile**
will not contain any Test Cases.

Note that you can also optionally save a **Profile** *before* actually
running your Test Case configuration, but in this case, you will not
have the advantage of knowing if the Test Case configuration performed
well or not, and whether you really want to save it --- for example, as
a test results baseline for a certain set of features you plan to
re-test for comparison after making changes in a protocol
implementation.

After you save a **Profile**, you can then use it in subsequent re-runs
of the profiled test environment where you use the **Load Profile**
option in PTM, as described in [Loading a Profile](#loading-a-profile);
or you can use the PTMCli.exe command line tool to launch Test Case
execution (see [Executing Test Cases From the Command
Line](#executing-test-cases-from-the-command-line)).

You can save a **Profile** by performing the steps that follow.

**To save a Profile that encapsulates the currently *selected* Test Case configuration**

1.  In the **Run Selected Test Cases** page of the PTM Wizard, select
    the Test Cases that you want in your **Profile**.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

    Please ensure that you *select* Test Cases *before* saving your
    **Profile**. This is especially important if you intend to use the
    PTMCli.exe command line with the -s switch, which specifies that only
    selected Test Cases will be executed in the **Profile**. See
    [Executing Test Cases From the Command Line](#executing-test-cases-from-the-command-line) for more
    information about PTMCli.exe.

2.  Just below the PTM Test Cases list view on the **Run Selected Test
    Cases** page of the PTM Wizard, click the **Export/Import** link, as
    shown in the figure that follows, and then click the **Save
    Profile...** drop-down menu item to save the selected Test Cases in
    the current test configuration along with all the underlying related
    properties.

    ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image35.png)
    #### **Figure 22. Protocol Test Manager: Saving a test case Profile**

    This action should open a **Save** dialog. By default, the **Profile**
    is saved in the user **Documents** folder, but you can change the
    default by navigating to another directory location as necessary.

3.  Specify an appropriate name for the **Profile** and then close the
    open **Save** dialog.

#### **Loading a Profile**

After you have saved a **Profile** as described in [Saving a
Profile](#saving-a-profile), you can load the Test Case configuration of
the saved **Profile** into the PTM where you can execute the Test Case
configuration as is, or modify it before executing. To load a
**Profile**, perform the steps of the following procedure.

**To load a saved Profile into the PTM and execute the Test Case configuration**

  1.  On the **Configure Method** page of the PTM Wizard, click **Load Profile**. The Test Case configuration of the **Profile** displays in the **Run
  Selected Test Cases** tab of PTM.

  2.  To run all Test Cases of the **Profile**, click the **Run All** command beneath the Test Case list view. The Test Cases will run the same as any other set of Test Cases do
      with all the status indications that occur during normal Test Case execution progress.

  3.  To only run selected Test Cases from the **Profile**, first select
      the Test Cases you want to run and then click the **Run Selected
      Test Cases** command beneath the Test Case list view.

  4.  In either execution mode, observe that Test Case execution provides
      all the normal indicators as the tests progress to completion.

### Executing Test Cases from the Command Line

The PTM enables you execute the Test Case configuration of a previously
saved **Profile** with the use of a simple command string. In this mode
of Test Case execution, you will trigger this process from outside the
PTM UI test environment, which could also potentially be from a remote
location.

The application that enables you to do this is known as PTMCli.exe. The
PTMCli.exe is in PTMCli.zip that can be download from GitHub . then
extract this zip package to C: \\PTMCli

To execute the Test Cases of a **Profile** by using a command string,
perform the procedure that follows:

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

You *should not* run the PTMCli.exe application while the PTM is either
open or has Test Case execution in progress. If you do, the PTMCli.exe
application will not start or an error will occur, respectively.

**To load a Profile from the command line**

  1.  From the **Start** menu, type "Cmd" and then double-click the
    **Command Prompt** icon.
    <br/>Note that you might need to run the command console as Administrator.

  2.  From the command line, navigate to the following directory location
    on the **Driver** computer with the cd command:

          cd C:\PTMCli\

  3.  At the command line, type the following command string:

          PTMCli.exe -p <profilepath> -s

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note
       
       The -p switch requires you to specify the directory path to a saved
        **Profile** and the -s switch in this command enforces execution of
       selected Test Cases only.
       
       If you are using the -s switch and you have not selected any Test
       Cases, as described in [Saving a Profile](#saving-a-profile), the
       PTMCli.exe will report shortly after it begins running that it
       "Finished running test cases", which means that no tests were actually
       run. If this occurs, simply remove the -s switch from the PTMCli.exe
       command string and run PTMCli.exe again.

  4.  Confirm that the Test Case execution results begin to appear in the command console.

       With PTMCli.exe, test progress typically appears as % complete at the
       command line while the test results scroll through the command shell
       display.
       
![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

For additional information about functionality that is available with the PTMCli tool, use the -help switch to display it:

    PTMCli.exe <-help | -h>

# Viewing RDP Output Data with Message Analyzer

The **RDP Client Test Suite** output data consists of text logs and
HTML-based logs that you can read manually or as Test Case result
displays that are built into the PTM, as described in [Reviewing the
Test Results](#reviewing-the-test-results). You can also use Message
Analyzer to capture **RDP** **Client Test Suite** output data with the
use of the following message providers:

**Protocol-Test-Suite** --- enables you to capture the **Test Suite**
output log data and to highlight and expose specific types of messages
of interest with the use of Message Analyzer's **Color Rule** feature.

**Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** --- enables you to capture **Driver** and
**SUT** computer communications on the wire as Test Cases are executing.

In merging these two sources of data into a single Message Analyzer
session, it is much easier to understand what the Test Suite is doing
when you are debugging Test Cases; as Message Analyzer has many types of
filtering that you can apply to manipulate the data display to expose
and isolate target data of interest.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image3.png)Important

As of November 25 2019 - Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) was retired
and removed from public-facing sites on microsoft.com. A private MMA
build is available for testing purposes; to request it, send an email to
<getmma@microsoft.com>. However, note that Message Analyzer will
continue to be supported in this Test Suite only up until **RDP Client
Endpoint Test Suite** version 3.20.1.0. After that, a different tracing
and message analysis tool will take its place in this test suite.

This section describes how to install and configure MMA for use with the
**RDP Client Test Suite**, which includes deploying a set of **Color
Rules** for detection of certain **RDP Client Test Suite** output
message types.

![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image1.png) The major topics covered in this section
include the following:

  &emsp;&emsp;[Install and Configure Microsoft Message Analyzer](#install-and-configure-microsoft-message-analyzer)

  &emsp;&emsp;[Capturing RDP Traffic with Microsoft Message Analyzer](#capturing-rdp-traffic-with-microsoft-message-analyzer)

## Install and Configure Microsoft Message Analyzer

Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) is used to capture data on the wire and
merge it with data dumped by the **RDP Client Test Suite**. To install
and configure MMA for use with the **RDP Client Test Suite**, perform
the steps that follow:

**To configure MMA for use with the RDP Test Suite**

  1.  Install Microsoft Message Analyzer v1.4, if you have not already
    done so. See [Optional Software](#optional-software) for details on
    how to obtain the MMA installer.

  2.  Copy the OPN files in the directory that follows to your clipboard:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Data\SuperLogViewer\OPNs\*.opn

  3.  Paste the clipboard contents to the following MMA installation directory:

          C:\Program Files\Microsoft Message Analyzer\OPNAndConfiguration\OPNs\Microsoft\Windows\RemoteDesktop\

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Caution
      
      If this is not the first startup of MMA, then copy the OPN files to the following directory instead:

          C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MessageAnalyzer\OPNAndConfiguration\OPNs\Microsoft\Windows\RemoteDesktop

  4.  Start MMA by running as Administrator.

  5.  Click **Start Local Trace** to begin tracing in order to expose the **Color Rules** drop-down on the **Analysis Grid** toolbar.

  6.  Stop tracing by clicking the **Stop** button on the Message Analyzer ribbon.

  7.  Click the **Color Rules** drop-down in the **Analysis Grid** toolbar and select **Manage Color Rules**.

  8.  In the **Manage Color Rule** dialog, click the **Import** button and navigate to the following directory location on the **Driver** computer:

          C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Data\SuperLogViewer\

  9.  Select the **RDPColorRule.asset** file and then click **Open** in the **Select Library to Open** dialog to import the RDP **Color Rule** library.

      Observe that the RDP **Color Rules** display in the **Network** category, as shown in the figure that follows.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image36.png)

      #### **Figure 23. Message Analyzer Select Items to Import dialog**

  10. Click **OK** in the **Select Items to Import** dialog.

  11. In the **Manage Color Rule** dialog that appears, ensure that all the RDP **Color Rules** are selected in the **Network** category under **My Items**.

       ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note
       
       When you are reviewing trace results, all the RDP **Color Rules**
       should be selected and highlighting the appropriate messages. However,
       note that only one of the following **Color Rules** will display in
       the trace results, depending on whether RDP session security is set to
       use standard RDP Security or enhanced RDP Security (TLS):

       -   **RDP_Decrypted**

       -   **TLS_Decrypted**

       See [Common Required Property Settings](#common-required-property-settings) for further information.

## Capturing RDP Traffic with Microsoft Message Analyzer

After importing the RDP **Color Rules** for Microsoft Message Analyzer,
perform the steps that follow to capture RDP traffic and apply **Color
Rules** for identification of certain RDP messages.

**To configure an MMA session and capture local RDP traffic during Test Case execution**

  1.  On the Message Analyzer ribbon, click the **New Session** button to display the **New Session** dialog.

  2.  On the **New Session** dialog, click the **Live Trace** button to display the configuration for a new session.

  3.  In the **ETW Providers** pane, click **Add Providers** and then click **Add System Providers** in the context menu to display the **Available System Providers** list.

  4.  In the search text box, type **Protocol-Test-Suite**. When this provider displays in the list, select it and then click **Add To**.

      The **Protocol-Test-Suite** provider enables you to aggregate the data from **RDP Client Test Suite** logging.

  5.  Repeat the previous step for **Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture**. Click **OK** when done.

      This message provider enables you to capture data on the wire, such as any wire data that is produced by **Driver** and **SUT** computers during Test Case execution.

      The specified message providers should display in the **New Session** dialog, as shown in the figure that follows:

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image37.png)

      #### **Figure 24. Message Analyzer session message providers**

  6.  Start Test Case execution from the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) or by
      executing a specific protocol .ps1 file on which you want to focus.

  7.  In the **New Session** dialog of Message Analyzer, click the
      **Start** button to begin tracing.

  8.  As messages accumulate in Message Analyzer, observe that some of
      them will be highlighted with the activated **Color Rules**.

  9.  When PTM Test Case execution is complete, stop Message Analyzer
      tracing.

  10. Apply a filter to the test results by typing "Protocol_Test_Suite"
      in the Filtering text box and then click the filter **Apply** button
      in the Filtering panel under the session ID tab of the Message
      Analyzer user interface (UI), as shown in the figure that follows.

      Only the test result messages that originated from the **Protocol Test
      Suite** module should display in the Message Analyzer default **Analysis
      Grid** viewer. This should provide a simple way to get at the RDP output
      logging messages while filtering out all the others, as shown
      immediately below.

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image38.png)

      #### **Figure 25. Message Analyzer trace results with filtering**

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image4.png)Note

      At any point, you can merge the messages captured by the
      Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture provider back into the **Analysis
      Grid** display, by simply clicking the **Remove** button in the Filter
      panel under the session ID tab of the Message Analyzer UI to remove
      the filter you added.

      The table that follows describes the **Color Rules** and the origin of the messages that trigger them to display:

      **Table 22. Message Analyzer Color Rule data for RDP Test Suite**

      | **Color Rule**       | **Rule Activation Trigger**    | **Description**      |
      |----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
      | **RDP_CheckFailed**  | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Red background indicating that a check made in a Test Case failed. These are the same **[CheckFailed]** messages you will find in **StandardOut** category data in the PTM when selecting a Test Case following test execution. |
      | **RDP_Comment**      | RDP Test Suite Logs            | Brown background indicating a log message was dumped by the RDP Test Suite. These are the same **[Comment]** messages that you will find in **StandardOut** category data in the PTM when selecting a Test Case following test execution.  |
      | **RDP_Decompressed** | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Blue text indicating an RDP message was decompressed. |
      | **RDP_Decrypted**    | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Light green text indicating a decrypted message that used RDP security in the RDP session. |
      | **RDP_TestFailed**   | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Red background indicating that a test failed, with which the message is associated. <br/>These are the same **[TestFailed]** messages that you will find at the end of **StandardOut** category data in the PTM when selecting a Test Case following test execution. |
      | **RDP_TestPassed**   | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Green background indicating that a test passed, with which the message is associated. <br/>These are the same **[TestPassed]** messages that you will find at the end of **StandardOut** category data in the PTM when selecting a Test Case following test execution. |
      | **TLS_Decrypted**    | RDP Test Suite/Test Cases      | Light green text indicating a decrypted message that used TLS security in the RDP session. |

  11. The **\[CheckFailed\]** information tag and the others mentioned in
      this table are specified in [Test Results Output Status Indicators](#test-results-output-status-indicators). You might also
      consider using the Message Analyzer **Grouping Viewer** to isolate
      and organize the RDP data according to certain criteria, such as
      **Case Name**, **Message Name**, and **Comments**. If you do so, you
      may see your data organized in the **Grouping Viewer** in a fashion
      similar to what is shown in the figure that follows:

      ![](./image/RDP_ClientUserGuide/media/image39.png)

      #### **Figure 26. Message Analyzer Grouping viewer with RDP data**

      In the figure, note the Grouping viewer to the left of the **Analysis
      Grid**. The groups are organized such that you see the **CaseName**
      group data at top level with the **MessageName** and **Comments**
      group data nested successively underneath. Group data is defined by
      the Group identifiers above and is delineated by indented lines below.
      
      For example, in the figure that follows, observe how the data is
       nested in the graphic part of the viewer with the
      **Server_Control_PDU** line (**Comments** node data) under the message
      **RDPBCGR : SentSlowPathPDU** (**MessageName** node data) and this
      latter message under the test **BVT_AutoReconnect_PositiveTest**
      (**CaseName** node data).
      
       Also, when the **Server_Control_PDU** node is clicked, the number of
      messages captured for that operation are shown to the right in the
      **Analysis Grid** viewer. When you click one of those messages, you
      can get more message information in the MMA **Details** view.
      
      Note that the message groups are determined by the field selections
      you make under the **Protocol_Test_Suite** node in **Field Chooser**
      when you are setting up the **Grouping Viewer**, as shown in the right
      sector of the UI in the figure that follows.

|                  |                                                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **PROBLEM**     | The **SUT** computer does not respond to pings from the **Driver** computer.|
|  **CAUSE**       | The **Driver** computer is not in the same network segment as the **SUT** computer, or the **SUT** computer firewall is enabled.|
|  **RESOLUTION**  | Move the **Driver** computer and the **SUT** computer to the same network segment or disable the **SUT** computer firewall.|
|                  |                                                                            |

## Test Run Issues

**Table 24. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of Test Case execution issues**

|                  |                                                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PROBLEM 1**    | One or more Test Cases failed with a message such as "Timeout when expecting \<Message Type\> ".   |
| **CAUSE 1**      | For Windows RDP clients, the Test Suite must be run under the Administrator account. For non-Windows RDP clients, the SUT computer control adapter may be not implemented properly. See [RDPSUTControlAgent](#https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/tree/main/TestSuites/RDP/) for development information. |
| **RESOLUTION 1** | For Windows RDP clients, enable the Administrator account and log on as Administrator, as described in [Configuring the SUT](#configuring-the-sut). |
|                  |                                                  |
| **PROBLEM 2**    | One or more Test Cases failed with the Exception “The handle is invalid”. |
| **CAUSE 2**      | The **Driver** computer is locked while Test Cases are running. |
| **RESOLUTION 2** | Unlock the **Driver** computer when Test Cases are running. |
|                  |                                                                            |

## RDPEUSB Test Cases Fail

**Table 25. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of RDPEUSB Test Case execution issues**

|                |                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PROBLEM**    | A significant number of MS-RDPEUSB Test Cases are failing. |
| **CAUSE**      | The OSR USB FX2 board is not plugged into the SUT computer or the USB Redirection feature is not enabled in the SUT computer. |
| **RESOLUTION** | Plug an OSR USB FX2 board into the SUT computer USB hub. If you need to purchase an OSR USB FX2 board, see Table 2 in [Test Environment Computer Requirements](#test-environment-computer-requirements). <br/>Enable RDP USB Redirection via the Local Group Policy Editor, as described in [Configuring the SUT](#configuring-the-sut). |
|                |                                                                            |

## RDPEUDP and RDPEMT Test Cases Fail

**Table 26. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of RDPEUDP and RDPEMT Test Case execution issues**

|                |                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PROBLEM**    | A significant number of MS-RDPEUDP and MS-RDPEMT Test Cases are failing.|
| **CAUSE**      | Some MS-RDPEUDP and MS-RDPEMT Test Cases create an RDP-UDP connection, which must use the TLS or CredSSP security protocol to secure the RDP session.
| **RESOLUTION** | In the RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file, configure the RDP.Security.Protocol to TLS or CredSSP, as described in [Common Required Property Settings](#common-required-property-settings).
|                |                                                    |


## RDPBCGR Test Cases Fail When Running in PowerShell Mode

**Table 27. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of RDPBCGR Test Case failures**

|                |                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **RESOLUTION** |Run each RDPBCGR Test Case above using the following command:  <br/>&emsp;&emsp;RunTestCasesByFilter.ps1 -Filter "Name=TestCaseName" |
|                |                                                    |

## RDPEGFX Test Cases Require H264 Enabled on SUT

**Table 28. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of RDPEGFX Test Case failures**

|                |                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PROBLEM**    | If the SUT computer is a thin client that does not support the H264 codec of RDPEGFX, it is expected that the following three Test Cases will fail:<br/> -	RDPEGFX_H264Codec_PositiveTest_H264Support <br/> - RDPEGFX_H264Codec_PositiveTest_SendH264Stream <br/> - RDPEGFX_H264Codec_NegativeTest_IncorrectRegionRectsNum |
| **CAUSE**      | The H264 is not enabled for testing the H264 codec in RDPEGFX on a thin RDP client.|
| **RESOLUTION** | Enable H264 by configuring H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop connections, as described in [Configuring the SUT](#configuring-the-sut) and [Configuring the Driver Computer](#configuring-the-driver-computer). |
|                |                                                    |

## Test Cases Fail When Using the TLS or CredSSP Protocol

**Table 29. Problem, Cause, and Resolution of Test Case failures associated with TLS and CredSSP use**

|                  |                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PROBLEM 1**    | When using the TLS or CredSSP protocol, a significant number of Test Cases fail with a Timeout exception. |
| **CAUSE 1**      | The TLS and CredSSP protocol need more time to complete encryption and decryption processes. |
| **RESOLUTION 1** | In the **RDP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file, increase the value of the **WaitTime** property. To specify additional **WaitTime**, see [Optional Configuration Settings](#optional-configuration-settings). <br/>The .ptfconfig file is located in the following **Driver** computer directory: <br/>&emsp;&emsp;C:\\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\\Bin\\                                      |
|                  |                                                  |
| **PROBLEM 2**    | When using the TLS or CredSSP protocol, Test Cases fail with the following Exception: “The system cannot find the file specified.” |
| **CAUSE 2**      | The certificate file that is used to secure the TLS or CrepSSP transport did not successfully generate. |
| **RESOLUTION 2** | Re-run the script **Config-DriverComputer.ps1** on the **Driver** computer to regenerate a valid  certificate. This script is located in the following Driver computer directory:<br/>&emsp;&emsp;C:\RDP-TestSuite-ClientEP\Scripts\ <br/>For the execution command line, see step 7 in the first procedure of [Configuring the Driver Computer](#configuring-the-driver-computer). |
